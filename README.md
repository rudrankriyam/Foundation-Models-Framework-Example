## Usage Examples

### Basic Chat
```swift
let session = LanguageModelSession()
let response = try await session.respond(
    to: "Suggest a catchy name for a new coffee shop."
)
print(response.content)
```

### Structured Data Generation
```swift
let session = LanguageModelSession()
let bookInfo = try await session.respond(
    to: "Suggest a sci-fi book.",
    generating: BookRecommendation.self
)
print("Title: \(bookInfo.content.title)")
print("Author: \(bookInfo.content.author)")
```

### Tool Calling
```swift
// Weather Tool
let weatherSession = LanguageModelSession(tools: [WeatherTool()])
let weatherResponse = try await weatherSession.respond(
    to: "Is it hotter in New Delhi or Cupertino?"
)
print(weatherResponse.content)

// Web Search Tool
let webSession = LanguageModelSession(tools: [WebTool()])
let webResponse = try await webSession.respond(
    to: "Search for the latest WWDC 2025 announcements"
)
print(webResponse.content)

// Multiple Tools Example
let multiSession = LanguageModelSession(tools: [
    WeatherTool(),
    WebTool()
])
let multiResponse = try await multiSession.respond(
    to: "Check the weather in Tokyo and search for tourist attractions there"
)
print(multiResponse.content)

// Web Metadata Tool Example
let metadataSession = LanguageModelSession(tools: [WebMetadataTool()])
let metadataResponse = try await metadataSession.respond(
    to: "Generate a Twitter post for https://www.apple.com/newsroom/"
)
print(metadataResponse.content)
```

### Streaming Responses
```swift
let session = LanguageModelSession()
let stream = session.streamResponse(to: "Write a short poem about technology.")

for try await partialText in stream {
    print("Partial: \(partialText)")
}
```

## Data Models

The app includes comprehensive `@Generable` data models:

### Book Recommendations
```swift
@Generable
struct BookRecommendation {
    @Guide(description: "The title of the book")
    let title: String
    
    @Guide(description: "The author's name")
    let author: String
    
    @Guide(description: "Genre of the book")
    let genre: Genre
}
```

### Product Reviews
```swift
@Generable
struct ProductReview {
    @Guide(description: "Product name")
    let productName: String
    
    @Guide(description: "Rating from 1 to 5")
    let rating: Int
    
    @Guide(description: "Key pros of the product")
    let pros: [String]
}
```

## Custom Tools

### Weather Tool
Provides real-time weather information using OpenMeteo API:

- Format durations in human-readable format
- No external dependencies or API keys required

### Math Tool
Mathematical calculations and conversions:
- Basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide, power, sqrt)
- Statistical calculations (mean, median, standard deviation)
- Unit conversions (temperature, length, weight)
- Works entirely offline

### Text Tool
Text manipulation and analysis:
- Analyze text (word count, character count, statistics)
- Transform text (uppercase, lowercase, camelCase, snake_case)
- Format text (trim, wrap, truncate, remove newlines)
- No external dependencies

### Web Metadata Tool
Webpage metadata extraction and social media summary generation:
