# Code Audit Summary

## Key Findings
- `Foundation Lab/Views/Examples/Components/Spacing.swift:8` &mdash; The file only imports `Foundation` but defines multiple `CGFloat` constants. Without `CoreGraphics` or `SwiftUI`, the target fails to build because `CGFloat` is unresolved. Import the proper framework.
- `MurmerTests/MurmerTests.swift:242` &mdash; The test suite references `viewModel.showSuccess` and even `viewModel.stateMachine`, neither of which exist (the latter is private). This currently prevents the test target from compiling, masking regressions. Rewrite the expectations to use the public surface.
- `Physiqa/Models/HealthDataManager.swift:117`, `:139`, `:162`, `:181` &mdash; Health metrics are mutated from background tasks spawned via `withTaskGroup`. Because the manager is `@Observable` and SwiftData writes must occur on the main actor, these assignments need to hop back to `MainActor` to avoid UI races.
- `Foundation Lab/ViewModels/ChatViewModel.swift:52` &mdash; `isLoading` is set to `session.isResponding`, which is `false` before the stream begins. The send button stays enabled and users can queue overlapping requests. Set `isLoading = true` before starting the stream and reset it afterwards (e.g. with `defer`).
- `Murmer/Views/ContentView.swift:135` &mdash; The “Reminder Created” alert uses `Binding.constant`, so the binding never updates when `lastCreatedReminder` changes and the success alert never appears. Replace it with a real binding derived from the view model.
- `Murmer/ViewModels/MurmerViewModel.swift:177` &mdash; `showError(_:)` immediately schedules a `Task` that toggles `showError` back to `false` with no delay, making the error banner effectively invisible. Pause before clearing the flag (e.g. `try? await Task.sleep(...)`).

## Recommended Next Steps
- Patch the imports and test suite so the workspace builds cleanly and the tests execute.
- Fix the `HealthDataManager` concurrency issue to keep SwiftData usage main-actor confined.
- Harden the chat and reminder flows (`isLoading`, alerts, error banner timing) and then re-run the relevant UI flows/tests.
